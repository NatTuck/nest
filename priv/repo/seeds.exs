# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:
#
#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
#
# Idempotent: uses `Vocations.upsert_vocation/1` so re-running
# this script updates existing rows (system prompts, modes,
# tools) in place rather than failing on duplicate names or
# creating a second row. Safe to re-run after editing any
# vocation field below.
#
# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your
# repositories directly:
#
#     Nest.Repo.insert!(%Nest.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.
